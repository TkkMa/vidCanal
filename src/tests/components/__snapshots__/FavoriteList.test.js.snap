A trip to London might as well be a trip through history. This city has long been a hub for finance, education, and culture, and is full of modern construction mixed with ancient buildings. 

Your London tour must include St. Paulâ€™s Cathedral, one of its most well-known churches. Youâ€™ll also want to see the Tower of London, the Palace of Westminster, and Westminster Abbey for exquisite examples of the cityâ€™s famous architectural landmarks. Walk or jog through numerous green spaces, among them Hyde Park and Green Park, in the center of London.

Continue your London sightseeing in the West End, where youâ€™ll find ancient buildings converted into modern shops, restaurants, bars, and shows. Youâ€™ll find one of the largest theatre districts in the world here, and can take in a different play almost every night of the week. 

For a real treat, climb aboard the London Eye, a giant, rotating Ferris wheel, and see the old and new parts of the city all at once.

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.
React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.",

A trip to London might as well be a trip through history. This city has long been a hub for finance, education, and culture, and is full of modern construction mixed with ancient buildings. 

Your London tour must include St. Paulâ€™s Cathedral, one of its most well-known churches. Youâ€™ll also want to see the Tower of London, the Palace of Westminster, and Westminster Abbey for exquisite examples of the cityâ€™s famous architectural landmarks. Walk or jog through numerous green spaces, among them Hyde Park and Green Park, in the center of London.

Continue your London sightseeing in the West End, where youâ€™ll find ancient buildings converted into modern shops, restaurants, bars, and shows. Youâ€™ll find one of the largest theatre districts in the world here, and can take in a different play almost every night of the week. 

For a real treat, climb aboard the London Eye, a giant, rotating Ferris wheel, and see the old and new parts of the city all at once.

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.
React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.",

A trip to London might as well be a trip through history. This city has long been a hub for finance, education, and culture, and is full of modern construction mixed with ancient buildings. 

Your London tour must include St. Paulâ€™s Cathedral, one of its most well-known churches. Youâ€™ll also want to see the Tower of London, the Palace of Westminster, and Westminster Abbey for exquisite examples of the cityâ€™s famous architectural landmarks. Walk or jog through numerous green spaces, among them Hyde Park and Green Park, in the center of London.

Continue your London sightseeing in the West End, where youâ€™ll find ancient buildings converted into modern shops, restaurants, bars, and shows. Youâ€™ll find one of the largest theatre districts in the world here, and can take in a different play almost every night of the week. 

For a real treat, climb aboard the London Eye, a giant, rotating Ferris wheel, and see the old and new parts of the city all at once.

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.
React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.",
